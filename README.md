9975 FRC Bot ‚Äì Tank Drive with Headbutt
üìù Description

This project contains the basic tank drive code for our Team 9975 FRC robot. Along with standard driving functionality, the robot includes a unique headbutt function that rams into other bots at a high turn rate, giving it an aggressive competitive edge.

Instructions to Try It Out

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the project in your preferred FRC development environment (e.g., WPILib in VS Code).

Deploy the code to the robot using the standard FRC build and deploy commands.

Use the driver station to control the bot:

Left joystick ‚Üí left tank drive

Right joystick ‚Üí right tank drive

Right Trigger ‚Üí activate high turn rate ram mode

Inspiration

We wanted to create a simple yet effective driving base for our robot that could be quickly iterated on for competitions. The headbutt function was added as a fun and tactical feature to give our bot a way to disrupt opponents in a defensive or offensive strategy.
